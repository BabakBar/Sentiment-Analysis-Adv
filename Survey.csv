Q9,Q10
"Totally this bot is a usable, it mean is clear and easy to use.  The structure and purpose of the product can be evaluated for aim of collecting relevant information regarding a doctoral program.","In my personal experience, the design of the bot still needs more work to achieve ideal interaction. The interaction text of the bot and user should be visible and recognizable. 
The logo should be considered for the bot. 
The bot is not completely equitable since it does not provide the tools for users with diverse backgrounds ( The translator tool should be taken into consideration).
As for usability the service works well and is easy to use, while usefulness of the service solves the user's problem regarding asking questions.
Take into consideration the distinction between text and a link since a specific link should be touchable to click on it. 

To sum up, congratulation on your utmost efforts regarding providing the bot."
"Yes, it was surprisingly accurate!","It was quite good. However, I think I would have probably searched for the information browsing through the web before asking. Probably because I am quite analogic..."
"Yes, I found something but in general I don't feel good talking with a robot :)","1- When I wrote something, my message was printed on the left side but I prefered to see it on the right and the botÂ´s on the left , I don't know why. 
2- When the chatbox is loaded, I would like to see a welcome message by the bot or something like this ""I can help you finding answer of your questions"", before writing anything.
3- There is need of attaching documents. In some organisations, when chatbot can not solve an issue, a real human continue chatting in that case maybe we need to upload documents.
4- The name of chatbot is PhD_Assistant. Maybe the name can be more attractive and innovative. "
Yes,"I think it captures info correctly and respond rapidly, easy to get info if you are asking a simple and object question."
Yes it was accurate but I think get better in the future,"I was surprised, the idea is nice and will have a impact in the future"
"I assume the answers are all correct, but it seems the answers are not stored in the robot, but only the paths do. Anyway it tells something about where to find information, that's nice.","I prefer to check the official website to get information. If I'm going to use a robot, I prefer it to present the information to me directly, instead of telling me to contact the program director or supervisor."
"Not absolutely. For example: When I asked about course content, the bot replied with a link on supervisor's researches",The bot at an initial level appears to be well trained.
Somehow,Neutral
It is really impressive and useful to guide through the informations given. ,"Everything seems profetional just need to be improved with more information to determine all phrasal in order to understand all intentions of applicants to avoid of possible confusion.
WELL DONE   "
Yes,No
"Its at the very basic stage and is not doing a complete registration process. For now, its answering just 2 questions.",You can improve it by implementing a complete registration process and storing the user data somewhere in a DB and you can also fetch the deadlines date from a DB via APIs to make it better. This initial version does not explain anything at the moment.
Yes. I liked it when it provided a small description and links.,Very nice idea. I have seen chatbots in websites for customer service. But the idea of having such a tool in universities is a step forward. Specially when a student doesn't want to bother professors with simple or personal questions. A cool usecase can be to take appointments instead of using emails.  
yes,good starting point. I will suggest to add the links with direct access from the chat conversation and to suggest a contact email when the answer is not available.
a good implementation for a search query bot. ,"good implementation and will make it easier to navigate in the website by providing the links. 
Can links be made clickable?
bot unable to small talk yet. either remove it as an option from instructions here, and make it clear that this is just a bot to provide guidance to requested links and answers to relevant questions. Or improve small talk flows.
"
The bot is quite accurate. It gave me the information I was looking for and the response was super fast. I think implementing this chatbot would save time to professionals because they don't need to answer emails/requests from candidates and it would give a support to PhD candidates.  It would also push candidates to apply because they would be impressed by chatbots' efficiency. ,"The chatbots is efficient and super fast. I think it would be appreciated. Maybe it would be good to expand his knowledge domain (of course with time and necessary resources) and allow the chatbots to categorize answers. For instance, if the candidate asks something generic the chatbot could give him different answers based on a categorization of topics (it is an idea). "
In most cases the provided information is relevant but not detailed enough.,"The experience is nice. The chatbot can provide a sense of interaction, which is important to create engagement with potential applicants of the program. However, I am afraid the information provided by the chatbot is all already available on the PhD program website, and in the case of more detailed answers or specific questions, the chatbot offer little extra information."
The bot has only answers for the most basic questions. This is the same information you can easily find on the website. For more 'hard to find on the website' questions the bot is also not useful. ,Suggestion: The bot should be able to accept a certain degree of misspelling. 
Yes it was,"Overall it was fine. Chatbot provided somehow correct informations. It needs some improvements, but it will get better after learning about the questions."
"yes, it was.","I had an easy-going conversation, which provided me with all I need. I do not have any suggestions."
